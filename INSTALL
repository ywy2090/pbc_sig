INSTALLING THE PBC_BCE LIBRARY
==============================

First install the PBC library:

The PBC library needs the GMP library:

Currently the only easy way to compile this library is to use the
relatively obscure CMake system: install CMake, run "cmake ." and then "make".
I hope to fix this soon.
